# NASA Space Apps Challenge Project

This repository contains my submission for the NASA Space Apps Challenge.  
The project is a web application designed to help users analyze weather conditions for specific locations and dates. It provides insights into the likelihood of conditions such as very hot, very cold, very wet, or very windy days.

## Next Steps
- Integrate NASA Earth Observation datasets for historical and probabilistic analysis  
- Add statistical analytics to estimate probabilities of specific weather conditions  
- Provide export functionality for results in CSV/JSON format  
- Enhance dashboard with visualizations and user-friendly summaries

## Project Goal
The main objective of this project is to build a personalized weather analytics tool that leverages NASA Earth observation data. The tool will allow users to query weather conditions for specific times and locations, and provide probabilities of different weather scenarios to support better planning for outdoor activities.
